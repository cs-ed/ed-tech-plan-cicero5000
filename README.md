# **Educational Technology Plan**

The present *Educational Technology Plan* (ETP) describes the main steps that will be implemented in my classes at **Alhambra High School, California**. As computer technology continues to be an intergral part of the workforce in our society, I consider such technology to be a relevant in high school educaion. My goal is to incorporate computer technology in my teaching so the students can use it *to learn the subject more efficiently* and *to acquire computer skills to solve mathemtical problems*. In addition, I want to show my students how computer technology is used in real fie situations.

## Context

### Course

This ETP will be implemented during the teaching of *Elementary Satistics and Probability* class at Alhambra High School. This class is designed for the **seniors** who want to have a fourth year of mathematics; however, **juniors** who do not want to take the Mathematics 3 class may take this class as their *third required mathematics course* before graduation.

### Situation

The changes in the workforce, regarding data science and statistics, during the past years prompted the Alhambra Unified School District (AUSD) to start teaching Elementary Statistics and Probability at its three high school campuses. Due to budget constrains the Introduction to Data Science class has been discontinued. However, in the last 5 to 6 years, AUSD has provided all of its high school students an HP Chromebook to imcrease access to educational resources across multiple subjects and to umprove delivery of educational material. This ETP is thus, a response to the AUSD's directives to incorporate computer technology in our teaching. 

Each member of the faculty and clerical personnel of the AUSD also received an HP laptop to perform their respective job duties. Due to safety and confidentiality issues, no one is allowed to use their personal computer / laptop / tablet while at work in our campuses. Access to the AUSD Internet network is blocked to non-AUSD electronic devices (including students). 

Alhambra High School (AHS) is located in an urban area about 7 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and about 5 miles south of the city of Pasadena. About 45% of AHS students are Asian, 45% Hispanic and 10% other groups. The vast majority of the students receive some type of financial assistance either from the state or federal governments. Practically all AHS students qualify to receive free lunch.

The budget to purchase software is very limited at AUSD, but teachers have te opportunity to attend free professional development seminars at the district offices about web-based programs and applications. The AUSD computer technology service office is fairly well supplied and thier assistance is also very good and quick to respond. Each of the three high schools at AUSD has a full-time computer technology assistant.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
