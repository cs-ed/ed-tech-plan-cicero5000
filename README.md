# **Educational Technology Plan**

The present *Educational Technology Plan* (ETP) describes the main steps that will be implemented in my classes at **Alhambra High School, California**. As computer technology continues to be an intergral part of the workforce in our society, I consider such technology to be a relevant in high school educaion. My goal is to incorporate computer technology in my teaching so the students can use it *to learn the subject more efficiently* and *to acquire computer skills to solve mathemtical problems*. In addition, I want to show my students how computer technology is used in real fie situations.

## Context

### Course

This ETP will be implemented during the teaching of *Elementary Satistics and Probability* class at Alhambra High School. This class is designed for the **seniors** who want to have a fourth year of mathematics; however, **juniors** who do not want to take the Mathematics 3 class may take this class as their *third required mathematics course* before graduation.

### Situation

The changes in the workforce, regarding **data science and statistics**, during the past years prompted the *Alhambra Unified School District* (AUSD) to start teaching *Elementary Statistics and Probability* at its three high school campuses. Due to budget constrains the *Introduction to Data Science* class has been discontinued. However, in the last 5 to 6 years, AUSD has provided all of its high school students an *HP Chromebook* to imcrease access to educational resources across multiple subjects and to umprove delivery of educational material. This ETP is thus, a response to the AUSD's directives to incorporate computer technology in our teaching. 

Each member of the faculty and clerical personnel of the AUSD also received an HP laptop to perform their respective job duties. Due to safety and confidentiality issues, no one is allowed to use their personal computer / laptop / tablet while at work in our campuses. **Access to the AUSD Internet network is blocked to non-AUSD electronic devices (including students)**. 

*Alhambra High School* (AHS) is located in an urban area about 7 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and about 5 miles south of the city of Pasadena. About 45% of AHS students are Asian, 45% Hispanic and 10% other groups. The vast majority of the students receive some type of financial assistance either from the state or federal governments. Practically all AHS students qualify to receive free lunch.

The budget to purchase software is very limited at AUSD, but teachers have te opportunity to attend free professional development seminars at the district offices about web-based programs and applications. Some teachers have access to digital resources provided by the publishers of the textbooks, however, students do not have access to such digital resources. The *Elementary Statistics and Probability* class has access to web-based programs created by the publisher of the textbook. The AUSD computer technology service office is fairly well supplied and thier assistance is also very good and quick to respond. Each of the three high schools at AUSD has a full-time computer technology assistant.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

1. Class Management
   1. Google Classroom: all class material used in class such as general announcements, PowerPoint presentations, class assignments, homework assignments quizzes, tests are organized in each class section.
2. Class Delivery
   1. PowerPoint presentations and Google slides: the textbook publisher created several PowerPoint presentations to be used in the delivery of the class material; I have created a few more slides using Google slides.
   2. Google Vids: short videos created by the teacher explaining key concepts related to the lesson. Students can watch the Google Vids as a review on their own or at home when they are absent from school.
   3. Stapplet.com: This is a free web-based satistics computer program originally created by the publisher of the textbook (BFW Publishers) to answer and study the problems, questions and activities described in the textbook. Now it is under the management of the organization mathmedic.
   4. Google Sheets: to compensate a few limitations of stapplet.com Google sheets are used to teach about graphical displays of data and formatting of existing graphs.
3. Class Assessment
   1. Google Forms: short and quick assesments are created using Google Forms. Students receive immediate feedback about their answers. The questions on each of these assessments can be shuffled to minimize cheating.
   2. ZipGrade: longer and more complex assessments are created using ZipGrade. Students receive immediate feedback about their answers. The questions on each of these assessments can be shuffled to minimize cheating.
   3. PowerTeacher: AUSD has adopted in all their schools to use PowerTeacher as the required gradebook.
4. Communication
   1. Zoom: some faculty meetings, parent-teacher conferences, professional development seminars are conducted through Zoom.
  
All the aformentioned web-based software have been seleted to use at AUSD schools because they are fully compatible with the students' OS HP Chromebooks. 

### Hardware Specifications

1.Teacher's laptop

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
