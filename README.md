# **Educational Technology Plan**

The present *Educational Technology Plan* (ETP) describes the main steps that will be implemented in my classes at **Alhambra High School, California**. As computer technology continues to be an intergral part of the workforce in our society, I consider such technology to be a relevant in high school educaion. My goal is to incorporate computer technology in my teaching so the students can use it *to learn the subject more efficiently* and *to acquire computer skills to solve mathemtical problems*. In addition, I want to show my students how computer technology is used in real fie situations.

## Context

### Course

This Educational Technology Plan will be implemented during the teaching of Elementary Satistics and Probability class at Alhambra High School. This class designed for the seniors who want to have a fourth year of mathematics; however, juniors who do not want to take the Mathematics 3 class may take this class as their third required mathematics course before graduation.

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
