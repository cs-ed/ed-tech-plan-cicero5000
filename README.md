# **Educational Technology Plan**

The present *Educational Technology Plan* (ETP) describes the main steps that will be implemented in my classes at **Alhambra High School, California**. As computer technology continues to be an intergral part of the workforce in our society, I consider such technology to be a relevant in high school educaion. My goal is to incorporate computer technology in my teaching so the students can use it *to learn the subject more efficiently* and *to acquire computer skills to solve mathemtical problems*. In addition, I want to show my students how computer technology is used in real fie situations.

## Context

### Course

This ETP will be implemented during the teaching of *Elementary Satistics and Probability* class at Alhambra High School. This class is designed for the **seniors** who want to have a fourth year of mathematics; however, **juniors** who do not want to take the Mathematics 3 class may take this class as their *third required mathematics course* before graduation.

### Situation

The changes in the workforce, regarding **data science and statistics**, during the past years prompted the *Alhambra Unified School District* (AUSD) to start teaching *Elementary Statistics and Probability* at its three high school campuses. Due to budget constrains the *Introduction to Data Science* class has been discontinued. However, in the last 5 to 6 years, AUSD has provided all of its high school students an *HP Chromebook* to imcrease access to educational resources across multiple subjects and to umprove delivery of educational material. This ETP is thus, a response to the AUSD's directives to incorporate computer technology in our teaching. 

Each member of the faculty and clerical personnel of the AUSD also received an HP laptop to perform their respective job duties. Due to safety and confidentiality issues, no one is allowed to use their personal computer / laptop / tablet while at work in our campuses. **Access to the AUSD Internet network is blocked to non-AUSD electronic devices (including students)**. 

*Alhambra High School* (AHS) is located in an urban area about 7 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and about 5 miles south of the city of Pasadena. About 45% of AHS students are Asian, 45% Hispanic and 10% other groups. The vast majority of the students receive some type of financial assistance either from the state or federal governments. Practically all AHS students qualify to receive free lunch.

The budget to purchase software is very limited at AUSD, but teachers have te opportunity to attend free professional development seminars at the district offices about web-based programs and applications. Some teachers have access to digital resources provided by the publishers of the textbooks, however, students do not have access to such digital resources. The *Elementary Statistics and Probability* class has access to web-based programs created by the publisher of the textbook. The AUSD computer technology service office is fairly well supplied and thier assistance is also very good and quick to respond. Each of the three high schools at AUSD has a full-time computer technology assistant.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

1. Class Management
   1. Google Classroom: all class material used in class such as general announcements, PowerPoint presentations, class assignments, homework assignments quizzes, tests are organized in each class section.
2. Class Delivery
   1. PowerPoint presentations and Google slides: the textbook publisher created several PowerPoint presentations to be used in the delivery of the class material; I have created a few more slides using Google slides.
   2. Google Vids: short videos created by the teacher explaining key concepts related to the lesson. Students can watch the Google Vids as a review on their own or at home when they are absent from school.
   3. Stapplet.com: This is a free web-based satistics computer program originally created by the publisher of the textbook (BFW Publishers) to answer and study the problems, questions and activities described in the textbook. Now it is under the management of the organization mathmedic.
   4. Google Sheets: to compensate a few limitations of stapplet.com Google sheets are used to teach about graphical displays of data and formatting of existing graphs.
3. Class Assessment
   1. Google Forms: short and quick assesments are created using Google Forms. Students receive immediate feedback about their answers. The questions on each of these assessments can be shuffled to minimize cheating.
   2. ZipGrade: longer and more complex assessments are created using ZipGrade. Students receive immediate feedback about their answers. The questions on each of these assessments can be shuffled to minimize cheating.
   3. PowerTeacher: AUSD has adopted in all their schools to use PowerTeacher as the required gradebook.
4. Communication
   1. Zoom: some faculty meetings, parent-teacher conferences, professional development seminars are conducted through Zoom.
  
All the aformentioned web-based software have been seleted to use at AUSD schools because they are fully compatible with the students' OS HP Chromebooks. 

### Hardware Specifications

1.Teacher's laptop
   - HP ProBook 440 14 inch G10 Notebook PC.
   - Windows 11 Enterprise LTSC.
   - 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1335U processor.
   - 8.00 GB installed RAM.
   - 128 MB Graphics Card.
   - 237 GB SSD Storage.

*Note: teachers at AUSD have access at two Google accounts: one for professional, job related material and another to teach / interact with students (class related issues). Each account provides considerable amounts of cloud stoage.*

2. Student's HP Chromebook
   The students' HP chromebooks vary from one another. Some are new while others are three to four years old. All use the Chrome OS. Unfotunately, I do not have access to additional specifications. AUSD school discontinued the use of computer labs a few years ago.

### Application

Each new lesson starts with a hands-on activity; it includes students collecting and organizing data in a *Google sheet* and/or *Google document*. At the same time, the students have access to the *PowerPoint slides* that explain the theoretical aspect of the lesson. After the students have completed the hand-on activity, the teacher provides guided intruction by projecting his laptop screen into the classroom screen via an Epson projector. The students learn, during that time, how to use the different components of the *stapplet.com* website: different types of statistical graphs, linear regression, five-number summary, claim testing, probability calculations and few other topics. After the guided instruction, students work independently or in small groups (3 or 4students) on similar problems to the guided instructions. The students check each other's work and write a final report providing their reasoning and evidence that support their conclusions. The report is written on a Google document and submitted to the teacher via Google classroom.

All lesson assignments, instruction and support materials are organized in the class **Google classroom**. At the begginning of the lesson, the teacher provides a short introduction about what to do and the students start working as instructed. The *Google vids* provide information about the lesson (short lecture), instructions on how to complete the assignments and how to use the stapplet.com website for that particular lesson. Some students watch *Google vids* to listen again for instructions, the lecture for the day or to clarify some concepts they did not understand well. The *Google vids* are also available to the students who were absent; students can watch the *Google vids* to learn about the lesson, they aslo have access to the *PowerPoint slides*, textbook and *stapplet.com* website to complete the class assignments for the day.  

*Google forms* are used in the classromm for short, quick assessments: about 5 multiple choice questions or short answers. Google forms can automatically shuffle the order of the questions and multiple choice answers to minimize cheating. *ZipGrade* is used to create longer, more complex tests. During these tests, students have access to the stapplet.com website to do the approperiaate statistical calculations. Both, *Google forms* and *ZipGrade*, provide immediate feedback to the students about their scores. The students know their weaknesses and strengths about the lesson. The teacher also identifies quickly the needs of the students who failed the tests. Another advantage of *Google forms* and *ZipGrade* is that the students' scores can be transfered to **PowerTeacher** (AUSD teacher's gradebook) relatively easy. 

Students who are not competent in English yet, often use Google translator to complete the class assignments, tests and to communicate with the teacher. Regardless of their native language, all class assignments are to be completed and submitted to the teacher in English.

### Impacts

I consider my *Elementary Statistics and Probablity* class a **web-based class**. It relies heavily on *digital technology*; besides the paper copy of the textbook, students have access to the digital version of it. Even tough *Google documents* and *Google sheets* are relatively simple programs, they are powerful learning tools that can help students learn Statistics and Probability. The free *stapplet.com* website, when used properly, is an outstanding learning tool that enables the students to analyze complex events and make decisions. 

The AUSD provides a **chromebook** (the most expensive component of my class) to all the students. Regardless of their socio-economic background, my students have access to the **basic technology** needed in my class; *all the software used in my class is free and available to everyone*. If a student has to be absent for an extended period of time, he/she still has access to my class assignments; by logging in to *Google classroom*, the students can see and hear my short lecture through *Google vids*, then see the *PowerPoint slides*, read the digital textbook, work on the class assignments and submit them to me when they are completed. A student can request to have a *Zoom  meeting* if they want to receive additional help with the class assignments.  Parents may also request a *Zoom meeting* when they cannot come to school in person to talk about the educational progress of their children.

I update my class content every school year according the needs of the students and the current socio-ecenomic events. Updating and modifiying digital documents is relatively easy and the publishers of the textbook have granted permission to modify certain elements of the textbook. English learner students can digitlly translate my class material so they can undertand it easier and eventually become more proficient in the use of the English language. I can adapt my class marerial to satisfy the needs of the students with learning disabilities as they work at their own pace. Advanced students can work at their own pace without having to wait for other students who need additional time and assistance. *Google drive, Google classroom, PowerTeacher* and their different components help me to organize my class material and resources so I can present it and teach it to the best of my abilities.
